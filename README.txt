TODO:

- clean up
- Find out why ratio in sim is not right
        Its close. Arm looks right, ele does not
        
- Try to fix magcoder in sim

- Testing DogLog.
        This will add logging of robot, tuneable values, and unit support
        Note: It will publish to NT but not on a field with fms. That stuff should be still done with smartdashboard. TEST IN SIM WITH FMS BEFORE COMP!!!
        - DogLog.time(key,Command) not working on second run. Might just have to log this by hand or make my own. UPDATE. Made my own
        - set up tuneable values. Done. Need to fix to not make when there is fms!!!!!
        
- PathPlanner is not in vendep but in java folder sooo yeah

- LimeLight has been added. Need to check alot in code tho.
